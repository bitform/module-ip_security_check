## IP Security Check

The IP Security Check module provides an additional layer of security for your Form Tools installation. When someone
tries logging in, their IP address is compared against an IP whitelist or blacklist. If their IP isn't permitted
access, they are redirected to a denied page. This provides an effective means to forbid unwanted access.
