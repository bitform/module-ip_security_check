## module-ip_security_check

The IP Security Check module provides you with an additional layer of security for your Form Tools installation. When someone tries logging in, their IP address is compared against an IP whitelist or blacklist. If their IP isn't permitted access, they are automatically redirected to a denied page. This provides an effective means to forbid unwanted access.

This module overrides the standard Form Tools user account system. Even if the person logging in has a valid username and password, this module can still forbid them access.
